# kNN Implementation in C++

This repositoire contains a kNN implementation in C++ in the knn.hpp header file.

The read_csv.hpp header file contains a class that reads .csv files and stores
them in a two-dimension array.

The "guilherme_braga.cpp" file contains an example of the class in action, integrating
both header files. The reason it is named like so is because this was an college assignment,
and the professor required that the file was named as such.
